Ruby [Action Cable](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) client library for Kotlin.

## About Vinted's fork

This is a fork of original library: https://github.com/hosopy/actioncable-client-kotlin

Main changes compared to original version:

* Introduced stable version of Kotlin coroutines
* Updated okhttp 2.x ---> okhttp 3.x
* Changed serializer klaxon ---> gson

## Contribution

Pull requests are always welcome.

# Usage

## Requirements

* Kotlin 1.3 or later
* [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) 1.3.x or later
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) 2.x 
* [okhttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) 3.x

## Download

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.TwoThreeSevenPlatform:actioncable-client-kotlin:<version>'
}
```

## Basic

```kotlin
// Setup
val uri = URI("ws://cable.example.com")
var consumer = ActionCable.createConsumer(uri)

// Create subscription
val fooChannel = Channel("FooChannel")
val subscription = consumer.subscriptions.create(fooChannel)

subscription.onConnected = {
    // Called when the subscription has been successfully completed
}

subscription.onRejected = {
    // Called when the subscription is rejected by the server
}

subscription.onReceived = { data: Any? ->
    // Called when the subscription receives data from the server
    // Possible types...
    when (data) {
        is Int -> { }
        is Long -> { }
        is BigInteger -> { }
        is String -> { }
        is Double -> { }
        is Boolean -> { }
        is JsonObject -> { }
        is JsonArray<*> -> { }
    }
}

subscription.onDisconnected = {
    // Called when the subscription has been closed
}

subscription.onFailed = { error ->
    // Called when the subscription encounters any error
}

// Establish connection
consumer.connect()

// Perform any action
subscription.perform("away")

// Perform any action with params
subscription.perform("hello", mapOf("name" to "world"))

// Terminate connection
consumer.disconnect()
consumer = null
```

Few notes:
- You can create new channels and instantiate corresponding subscriptions after ```consumer.connect()``` call. 
- It is allowed to have multiple subscriptions for the single channel. 
- You can check if at least one subscription exists for the particular channel via: ```consumer.subscriptions.contains(channel)```

## Passing Parameters to Channel

```kotlin
val chatChannel = Channel("ChatChannel", mapOf("room_id" to 1))
```

The parameter container is `Map<String, Any?>` and is converted to `JsonObject(Gson)` internally.
To know what type of value can be passed, please read [Gson user guide](https://github.com/google/gson).

## Sending Data via Subscription

```kotlin
subscription.perform("send", mapOf(
    "comment" to mapOf(
        "text" to "This is string.",
        "private" to true,
        "images" to arrayOf(
            "http://example.com/image1.jpg",
            "http://example.com/image2.jpg"
        )
    )
))
```

The parameter container is `Map<String, Any?>` and is converted to `JsonObject(Gson)` internally.
To know what type of value can be passed, please read [Gson user guide](https://github.com/google/gson).

## Options

```kotlin
val uri = URI("ws://cable.example.com")
val options = Consumer.Options()
options.connection.reconnection = true

val consumer = ActionCable.createConsumer(uri, options)
```

Below is a list of available options.

* sslContext

    ```kotlin
    options.connection.sslContext = yourSSLContextInstance
    ```

* hostnameVerifier

    ```kotlin
    options.connection.hostnameVerifier = yourHostnameVerifier
    ```

* query
    
    ```kotlin
    options.connection.query = mapOf("user_id" to "1")
    ```
    
* headers
    
    ```kotlin
    options.connection.headers = mapOf("X-Foo" to "Bar")
    ```
    
* reconnection
    * If reconnection is true, the client attempts to reconnect to the server when underlying connection is stale.
    * Default is `false`.
    
    ```kotlin
    options.connection.reconnection = false
    ```
    
* reconnectionMaxAttempts
    * The maximum number of attempts to reconnect.
    * Default is `30`.
    
    ```kotlin
    options.connection.reconnectionMaxAttempts = 30
    ```

* webSocketFactory
    * Pass your own instance of OkHttp `WebSocket.Factory`
    * Note: if you provide a custom `WebSocket.Factory` implementation, then `sslContext` and `hostnameVerifier` options are ignored. You must set those options directly in your custom implementation instead of setting it on `options.connection`. 

    ```kotlin
    options.connection.webSocketFactory = OkHttpClient.Builder().apply {
        // Configure your OkHttpClient how you like
        networkInterceptors().add(StethoInterceptor())
        sslSocketFactory(yourSocketFactory)
        hostnameVerifier(yourHostnameVerifier)
    }.build()
    ```

## Authentication

How to authenticate a request depends on the architecture you choose.

### Authenticate by HTTP Header

```kotlin
val options = Consumer.Options()
options.connection.headers = mapOf("Authorization" to "Bearer xxxxxxxxxxx")

val consumer = ActionCable.createConsumer(uri, options)
```

### Authenticate by Query Params

```kotlin
val options = Consumer.Options()
options.connection.query = mapOf("access_token" to "xxxxxxxxxxx")

val consumer = ActionCable.createConsumer(uri, options)
```
